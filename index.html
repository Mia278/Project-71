  <h1>School Achievments</h1>
<h3>And we see results in students’ skills in math, reading, composition, public speaking, self-management, and independent thinking.
<br>
We also see results in standardized test scores. Standardized test results are neither the only nor the most important measure of success, but they do measure students’ comparative academic skill sets. The results are useful in evaluating and demonstrating students’ ability to apply knowledge to largely concrete problems.
<br>
On the 2019 Iowa Assessments, a nationally standardized test, Challenger kindergartners’ average percentile rank was 98. Eighth grade students’ average rank was 99. That means that Challenger’s average kindergartner outscored 98 of 100 of IOWA takers at his grade level—and that Challenger’s average eighth grader outscored 99. The results against the private school group of test takers—expected to be an academically stronger group—are similarly impressive.
<br>
The IOWA results show a significant advantage for Challenger kindergartners. The results are similar in all grades—some a bit lower and some a bit higher, but all far ahead of the norm.
<br>
Challenger students learn to reason and critically evaluate ideas independently. They also learn to find joy and self-worth through achievement. These are things that standardized assessments do not measure but that are critically important to a child’s success in life.
<br>
Our students are also high achievers outside of school, and we enjoy seeing and showcasing their achievements in areas as diverse as academics, martial arts, team sports, dance, art, music, entrepreneurship, technology, and many more. The Challenger advantage is for life, and the path to high achievement begins early.
<br>
Start early and start right at Challenger School.

                <p>Challenger students dazzled at Speech Festival this year! Nicole E. of Lone Mountain won the Nevada Region Speech Festival, with Ellie L. and Tas H. in second and third place, respectively. In California, the winner was Arhana A. of Strawberry Park, with Sama K. of Sunnyvale as runner-up, and Ada P. of Ardenwood in third. Utah’s champion was Emma S. of Sandy, and her Sandy classmate Priyanka M. and Salt Lake's Harleen S. rounded out the top three. Challenger is proud of our well-spoken, poised, and confident speakers.

          <p class="p_modal">In 1960, while teaching in a public school, Barbara Baker became alarmed that her first grade students had received no academics in kindergarten, depriving them of the best years for establishing a foundation for learning.Public schools had dropped phonics in favor of the “sight method” (teaching reading by memorizing one word at a time). Imagine! Reading without phonics! Just before the birth of her fifth child, she decided to leave the comfort of the public schools and started her own preschool where she could teach phonics to children before they went to public school. “I figured that if they learned phonics in preschool, no one could take that away from them. And in the meantime, I could teach my new little daughter and teach only in the mornings.”<br>
